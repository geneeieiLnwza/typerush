Moo escapes from a farm. Moo is hungry. He does not want to eat grass. Moo is looking for McDonaldâ€™s. Moo loves cheeseburgers. Moo wants a double cheeseburger and French fries. He saw an advertisement on a billboard. He dreams about it every night.
The monkey runs in the jungle. The monkey is hungry. He spots a banana in a tree. It is big and yellow. He climbs up the tree. He eats the banana. He sees another banana. He eats that one too. The monkey is hungry no more.
EEEEEEEEEEE
